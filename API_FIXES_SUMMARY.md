# Backend API Fixes Summary

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed Syntax Errors in AuthController.java**
   - Removed duplicate catch block in forgotPassword method
   - Fixed proper scoping of catch blocks

2. **Created StandardizedResponseDTO**
   - Added AuthResponseDTO class for consistent response format
   - All authentication endpoints now return the same JSON structure
   - Response includes: success, token, message, role, name, email

3. **Updated Authentication Methods**
   - Login method now returns user profile info along with token
   - Signup method now generates token for auto-login
   - Google login and forgot password also use standard response format

4. **Added API Documentation**
   - Created AUTH_API_DOCS.md with detailed response format info
   - Updated FRONTEND_API_GUIDE.md with new token handling examples

## Testing Your Changes

1. Run the restart script to rebuild and restart the server:
   ```powershell
   .\restart.ps1
   ```

2. Test the APIs using one of the HTTP test files:
   ```
   src\test\http\auth_response_test.http
   ```

3. Check that the responses match the expected format:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "token": "your.jwt.token",
     "message": "Authentication successful",
     "role": "STUDENT",
     "name": "Test User",
     "email": "test@example.com"
   }
   ```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend now needs to:

1. Update API client to handle the new response format
2. Extract token along with user information from responses
3. Store user profile details (name, email, role) along with the token
4. Check the `success` field to determine if operations succeeded

## Next Steps

1. Implement actual Google login functionality
2. Implement password reset functionality
3. Update the frontend code to match the new API response format
4. Enhance error handling for edge cases
