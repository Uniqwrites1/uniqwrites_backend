# Backend Configuration Checklist

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ **CORS Configuration**
   - Added support for both React (port 3000) and Vite (port 5173) frontends
   - Configured proper headers, methods and credentials
   - Implemented CORS at both Spring MVC and Security levels
   - Added special handling for OPTIONS pre-flight requests
   - Set appropriate exposed headers for authorization

2. ✅ **JWT Authentication**
   - JWT secret key loaded from application.yml
   - Authentication endpoints properly exposed
   - Protected routes secured with Spring Security

3. ✅ **Required Endpoints Created**
   - ✅ `/api/auth/signup` - User registration
   - ✅ `/api/auth/login` - User login
   - ✅ `/teacher/apply` - Teacher application
   - ✅ `/parent/requests` - Parent request form
   - ✅ `/school/request` - School request form
   - ✅ `/dashboard` - Dashboard access
   - ✅ `/feedback` - Feedback submission
   - ✅ `/jobs/{id}/apply` - Job application

4. ✅ **Testing Endpoints**
   - Added test endpoints for verification
   - Created backend_health_check.http file

## How to Test

1. Ensure the backend server is running on port 8080
2. Use the `backend_health_check.http` file to test each endpoint
3. Use the `cors_test.http` file to specifically test CORS functionality
4. Check JWT token generation and validation
5. Verify CORS with the Vite frontend from port 5173
6. Use the `/api/test/cors-test` endpoint to quickly verify CORS is working

## Security Configuration

- CSRF protection disabled for API
- CORS configured properly
- JWT token validation middleware active
- BCrypt password encoding
- Public vs. protected endpoints separated

## Notes

- All endpoints can be tested with the provided HTTP files
- Test files available: api.http, api_endpoints_test.http, api_test.http, backend_health_check.http
